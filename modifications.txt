Newly installed apps:
	pip install django-extensions
	pip install uuid



Places Edit were made:

1. modified the way secret key was set: setting up a default secret key for anyone that wants to test the code only without having to define their own key.

2. adding AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'school_app.School' to project settings.py file to avoid error E304 conflicts

3. changed INSTALLED_APPS list to 'school_app','uuid','django_extensions' to avoid app not found error

4. installed uuid
	imported uuid to models.py
	changed the Debtors class id from "models.ForeignKey(primary_key=True, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE)" to models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False) to escape foreign key error of 'to ( where it points to)' and 'on_delete' error.
	Note: uuid creates a long string of id which can be sliced. It was used without truncation just to solely avoid the above mentioned error.

5. Changed the GENDER_CHOICES of Debtors class from a tuple to django text choice class to avoid calling a mere attribute with choice function which it does not possess.
